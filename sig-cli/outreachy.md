## What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes builds upon 15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

## What are SIGs / What is SIG-CLI?
Kubernetes is a set of projects, each shepherded by a special interest group (SIG). To get a grasp of the projects that we work on, check out the complete [list of SIGs](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-list.md).

SIG-CLI Covers kubectl and related tools. We focus on the development and standardization of the CLI framework and its dependencies, the establishment of conventions for writing CLI commands, POSIX compliance, and improving the command line tools from a developer and devops user experience and usability perspective.  

**Commuication:**

SIG-CLI Mailing List - kubernetes-sig-cli@googlegroups.com  
Slack - k8s.slack.io for invite; #sig-cli channel

**Mentors**
